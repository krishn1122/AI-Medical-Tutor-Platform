# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The AI Medical Tutor Platform team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/yourusername/nextlpc-interactive-demo/security/advisories/new) tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

## Security Considerations

### API Keys
- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use the principle of least privilege for API access

### Data Privacy
- Medical education data should be handled with care
- No personal health information (PHI) should be stored
- Follow GDPR and other applicable privacy regulations
- Implement proper data encryption for sensitive information

### Authentication
- Use secure authentication methods
- Implement proper session management
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Validate all user inputs

### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities
- Use tools like `npm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities
- Monitor security advisories for used packages

## Security Best Practices

When contributing to this project:

3. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in your test suite

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under support
4. Release new versions as soon as possible
